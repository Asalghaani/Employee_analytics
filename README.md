## 📁 Dataset

We’re working with a dataset called `employee_records.csv`. It contains:

- 🆔 `Employee_ID`  
- 👤 `Employee_Name`  
- 🎂 `Age`  
- 🌍 `Country`  
- 🏢 `Department`  
- 💼 `Position`

## 📓 Notebooks

### 📘 `analysis.ipynb`

- 🧹 Loads and explores the dataset  
- 📊 Plots **age** and **salary** distributions  
- 🌎 Shows employee count by **country**  
- 🏬 Highlights department sizes  

### ⚙️ `test_model.ipynb`

- 🔁 Prepares the dataset for machine learning  
- 🧠 Trains a basic model (Random Forest) to classify **high vs. low salary**  
- 📏 Outputs accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
